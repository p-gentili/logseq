Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcrafters-reboot/24625)) are working to land snap install documentation and the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml) upstream so [Project] can authoritatively publish future releases.

  - [x] Click the green "Use this template" button above to create a new repository based on this template
  - [ ] Give the newly created repository a sensible name, like `godzilla` if you're snapping the Godzilla software (*Note: Do not use `snap` in this name.*)
  - [ ] Update the description of the repository to `Unofficial snap for [Project]`
  - [ ] Update logos and references to `[Project]` and `[my-snap-name]`
  - [ ] Create a snap that runs in `devmode`

  - [ ] Fix all important issues found during testing
  - [ ] Make a post in the Snapcraft Forum ["store-requests" category](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/store-requests/19) asking for a transfer of the snap name from you to Snapcrafters - [link]()
  - [ ] Ask a [Snapcrafters admin](https://github.com/orgs/snapcrafters/people?query=%20role%3Aowner) to fork your repo into github.com/snapcrafters, and configure the repo for automatic publishing into edge on commit
  - [ ] Add the provided Snapcraft build badge to this `README.md`
  - [ ] Publish the snap in the Snap store stable channel
  - [ ] Update the install instructions in this `README.md`
  - [ ] Post an announcement in the Snapcraft Forum ["Snapcrafters" category](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/snapcrafters/23) - [link]()
