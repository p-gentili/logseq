## Install

```bash
sudo snap install logseq
```

### Using GIT sync

In case you're using GIT sync with SSH authentication you may want to connect the `ssh-keys` interface with:

```bash
sudo snap connect logseq:ssh-keys
```

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/logseq)

## Remaining tasks

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcrafters-reboot/24625)) are working to land snap install documentation and the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml) upstream so Logseq can authoritatively publish future releases.
